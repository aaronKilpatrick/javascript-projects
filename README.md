# javascript-projects

As someone who has always had a fascination with coding, studied Bach. of Computer Science and have always had something to do with Web Development, I have only really decided to dive head first into. My current job see's me working with Wordpress to build and manage an E-Commerce site. I noticed that I was Googling for help with Javascript far too often and that I needed to cement the knowlege to be more efficient.

I recently read an article discussing the benefits of the *100 Javascript Projects in 100 Days* challenge. The article mentioned various reasons why developers should partake in this challenge. All of them seemed obvious and yet I never thought to start such an endeavour before.

I decided then and there that before I moved onto learning a framework I would tackle this task and become a better Javascript Developer. This repository is my log of this endeavaour of taken my Javascript to the next level.

**A note on these projects:**
Most projects come with the HTML and CSS already written which allows me to focus on the goal of Javascript retention and recall.
Projects I **make from scratch** will have a **S-** before the project title

## Project 001 - Rock Paper Scissors

**Javascript Used:**
* Dom Manipulation
* Event Listeners
* Control Structures
* Arrays

This was a very simple project that does not look nice at all and it functions to the barest amount and yet I found this project a little cumbersome. I know how simple it is and yet I kept making small errors. It didn't take to me too long, but definitely longer than it should of, but I am glad I made so many little errors. It means I won't make them in the future.

## Project 002 - Change Color Background

**Javascript Used:**
* Arrays
* DOM Manipulation
* Event Listeners

This was far simplier than the first. 6 lines of code and I was done in about 10 minutes. I am getting better at event listeners and Query Selecting.

## Project 003 - Hex Color Background Changer

**Javascript User:**
* Arrays
* Control Structures
* DOM Manipulation
* Event Listeners

I tackled this project on the back of Project 002. It was fairly simple again. Didn't take longer than 10 minutes. I had an idea to push each hexadecimal number onto an array and then spread the array but over complicating the problem. I simply just concatenated each number onto a string as the loop iterated.

## Project 004 - Pass the Message

**Javascript Used:**
* Control Structurs
* DOM Manipulation
* Event Listeners
* IIFE

I'm certainly getting in to the eventListener/DOM Manipulation groove. Writing them is becoming very easy, if not second nature. I haven't had to do much DOM Manipulation other than changing text or colours but I know the theory and the syntax so I hope when I get to some more advanced DOM Manipulation I will be ready.

## Project 005 - Random Quotes
**Javascript Used:**
* Arrays
* DOM Manipulation
* Event Listeners
* IIFE
* Objects

More or less stuff I have done in the previous projects but with objects being included. No more than 10 minutes to complete.

## Project 006 - Counter
**Javascript Used:**
* Array.forEach
* Control Structures
* DOM Manipulation
* Event Listeners

This was again a very simple project. Around 10 minutes. I had to look up the syntax for forEach loops as they differ from PHP and other for loops I have used.

## **S-** Project 007 - Live Clock (added background changer as well)
**Javascript Used:**
* Arrays
* Control Structures
* Date()
* DOM Manipulation
* Objects
* Timing Events

I created the whole project from scratch. I started with just the clock functionality I had to look up the *padStart()* method. Then I
moved on to the background changer. I had to look up the *.remove()* method but it
went smoothly. Lastly I added the photographer of the image to the bottom right
of the screen. I am very happy with this project, even though it is simple.

## Project 008 - Background Image Slider
**Javascript Used:**
* Arrays
* Control Structures
* DOM Manipulation
* Event Listeners
* IIFE
* Template Literals

This project was fairly simple. I looked up *template literals* as I was sure there was another way to include a snippet in between a string without concatenation.
My first thought was to loop and push the images into the array but for 5 images I thought to keep it simple.
I am not sure if there is a way to directly pull file names directly from local storage other than JSON with AJAX but I will definitely look into it.
